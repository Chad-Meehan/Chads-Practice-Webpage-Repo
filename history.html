  <h1>History</h1>

  <p>This is the history of the Brocadero ficticious company.</p>
  <p>The company was founded by <b>Joe Nobody</b> in the year 1974. Joe named
    himself President, CEO, Owner, Founder, CFO, General Manager, and
    Vice President In Charge Of Good Times. He then fired himself and
    just concentrated on the good times.</p>
  <p>So this is where we find ourselves now. We basically have no history.</p>
